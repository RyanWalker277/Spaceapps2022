# PROSPECTOR

Prospector is an AR based web application that observes the International Space Station's current location in real-time, and view the station's location. It provides brief information about the various modules of the ISS. It gives you tour of the interior and exterior if the space station. In the future through VR we hope to familiarize the ASCANS with the working and the environment of the ISS. To develop our project we used UNITY GAME ENGINE- a 2D &3D tool that provides the most robust tools for development, GOOGLE ARCORE- platform for building augmented reality experiences, C# - used for scripting.


### Why Prospector?
The history and making of the ISS made us very eager to explore and learn more about the station. Further with the 3D model and API to track the location inspired us to develop an AR based project that can locate the ISS and also provide a tour of the station.

## Features

- Trach the Location of ISS in the Real-Time : Bing Maps SDK is used to track the ISS. Moreover, Implemented 3D visuals in the web app in order to make the tracking of ISS easier. These 3D visuals are highly interactive and user-friendly for all age groups.
- Visit the ISS's interior : Use your customised Avatar to enter and explore the ISS and all the integrated modules.
- Get the information about the various modules : There are several modules in the ISS such as ZVEZDA, NAUKA(MLM-U), Unity Module, RASSVET(MRM-1) and so on. The Prospector allows its user to explore and read about them though 3D visuals.
- Get an learning environment, and an interactive method to get to know about the ISS.
